## Status

This module is an active WIP. [Hic Draconis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons)

Steps:

- [x] create a minimal shim for `@storybook/react` focused on aggregating story metadata
- [x] alias `@storybook/react` to our custom shim
- [x] add docz webpack entry for loading stories client-side into our custom shim
- [x] `Story` react component
- [x] `Stories` react component
- [ ] wrap `Story` in an iframe to mimic storybook environment as closely as possible
- [ ] ensure `Story` is rerendered if story changes during hot reload
- [x] support explicit story rendering via docz mdx files
- [ ] support implicit / automatic storybook rendering (plugin option to insert one virtual mdx entry for each story "kind")
- [ ] add docz webpack support for other loaders that storybook contains by default (eg, css)
- [ ] add support for custom storybook webpack configs
- [ ] add support for most popular storybook addons
- [ ] integration tests with various storybook fixtures
- [ ] example projects that showcase the storybook to docz conversion

- [ ] would like a way to add a docz anchor and link to Stories children so each Story `<h2>` is linked in the primary nav
